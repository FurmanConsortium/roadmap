# Roadmap
roadmap for involving Furman students in open-source projects determined by the Furman Data Science alumni council

## Charter
Data science resources are expensive, and hands-on opportunities through Furman for STEM majors are limited.  The purpose of this organization is to help students get plugged into the data science community prior to attending graduate school, and to help them get their feet wet with real-world analytics projects.

## Steps
1. Expand LinkedIn Data Scientists of Furman group to a critical mass.  Setting a target of <b>30 members</b>.
2. Reach out to the Furman Metropolitan Fellows for advice on setting up a relationship with Furman itself.
3. Connect with Furman professors who perform summer research projects, to provide them with real-world data projects.
4. Establish a long-tenure project with the university that helps push forward open-source technology within the data science space.
